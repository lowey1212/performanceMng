# Blueprint Copy Blocks (Snippets)

Purpose: Ready-to-paste text snippets for common Blueprint comment patterns. Keep these open in a text editor and copy blocks into Comment nodes, variable Descriptions, or macro/function headers.

Files in this folder:
- Function_Full.txt — Full header for a function/macro with Purpose, Inputs, Outputs, Notes
- Function_Compact.txt — Shorthand version for quick graphs
- EventGraph_Banner.txt — Top banner for a Blueprint's Event Graph
- Region_Header.txt — Section headers: [Init], [Runtime], [Events], [Debug]
- Variable_Description.txt — One-liner for Details panel descriptions
- Timeline_Async.txt — For timelines or latent steps
- Interface_Message.txt — For Blueprint Interfaces
- Macro_Entry_Description.txt — For macro library nodes
- Debug_Block.txt — For debug-only graph regions
- Flag_Switch_Comment.txt — For toggles/feature flags
- Loop_Perf_Warning.txt — Perf warning block for loops/traces
- See_Reference_Line.txt — One-line "See:" reference to local Epic docs or repo index

Tip: Use the same vocabulary and units as in Tooltip_Reference_Guide.md. Prefer short, scannable lines.
