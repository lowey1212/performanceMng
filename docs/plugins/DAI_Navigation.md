# DAI_Navigation Plugin Documentation

This page is a stable entry point. The detailed content was consolidated:

- Main API reference (Blueprint wrappers): see `docs/DAI_Navigation_Blueprint_API.md`
- Compatibility/legacy notes: see `docs/plugins/DAI__Navigation.md` (kept to preserve old links)

Notes:
- Designer-facing Blueprint surface uses DAI_ prefixed nodes only; legacy non-prefixed nodes were removed.
- Use `DAI.Nav.Help` in the console for a quick list of navigation commands at runtime.
