# DAI Map Utils Guide

This guide summarizes the tools available in DAI Map Utils and how to use them.

## Texture Post-Process

- Scan From CB: Add textures referenced by assets currently selected in the Content Browser.
- Scan Folder: Scan the given folder path (e.g., /Game/Textures) for textures to include.
- Alpha Threshold: Convert alpha to binary using threshold T (0..255).
- Bleed Padding (Px): Pad opaque colors into transparent regions to avoid mip bleeding.
- Feather (Px): Smooth/feather alpha edges by the given radius.
- Dilate (Px): Expand colors into transparent areas by N pixels.
- Export PNG: Export processed outputs as PNG files alongside the source.
- GPU Preview: Generate previews using GPU for speed (approximate results).
- Rebuild Previews: Regenerate before/after thumbnails.
- Apply Selected: Run enabled operations on the selected textures.

Tips:
- Use “Select All/None/Invert” to manage batch selections quickly.
- You can preview Before/After thumbnails; they are 4x larger for clarity.

## Alpha Inspector

- Scan From CB: Analyze alpha usage for textures referenced by CB selection.
- Scan All Textures: Analyze alpha for all textures in the project.
- Enforce Masked On Materials: Sets materials using selected textures to Masked mode.
- Toggle “Alpha/RGB” button per row to preview.

## Texture Audit

- Scan Textures: Find common issues (compression, LODGroup, settings).
- Hide OK: Hide rows without problems.
- Fix Selected: Attempt to auto-fix selected issues.

## Asset Validation (Materials & Physics)

- Scan: Detect material/physics configuration issues.
- Only Materials / Only Physics: Filter the problem list.
- Auto-Fix Selected: Attempt to resolve selected issues automatically.

## Folder Issues

- Scan: Detect assets in unexpected folders.
- Fix Selected Moves: Move selected assets to their expected locations.

## Asset Batch Renamer

- Use CB Roots: Use Content Browser selection as scan roots.
- Scan: Build a rename preview list.
- Apply Selected: Perform renames.
- Undo Last Batch: Revert the last applied batch.
- Export/Import Presets: Save/load rename rules.

## Troubleshooting

- If previews don’t update, click “Rebuild Previews”.
- Ensure the Content Browser selection is valid before scanning from CB.
- Check the Output Log for detailed messages from Map Utils actions.
