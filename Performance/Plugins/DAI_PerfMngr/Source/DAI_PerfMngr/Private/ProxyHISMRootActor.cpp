// This actor exists only as a parent/holder for Hierarchical Instanced Static Mesh (HISM) components.
// Those components let us render many copies of the same mesh very efficiently.
// No extra code is needed here—the behavior lives in the manager.
#include "ProxyHISMRootActor.h"

// This file just includes the header for the ProxyHISMRootActor.
// All logic (if any) is handled in the header or elsewhere.
// No extra code is required here unless you want to add custom C++ behavior to the actor.
